The VIDemo demo program shows how to use the TPJVersionInfo component to read
the version information from any executable file that contains it.

Run the program then enter the full path to an executable file in the edit box.
Click refresh to display the version information.

If the program contains version information string file information in more than
one language (translation) the "Translation" drop down list will display each
one. Select a translation to display its string file information.

*** NOTE: To compile with Delphi 2007 first delete the .dproj file then load the
          project from the .bdsproj file.
