HelpEgs v1.0 of 17 February 2002
+ Added ability to access all "translations" stored in a file's version information, rather than just first one. This has been done so that code using earlier versions of this component should continue to work unchanged.
+ Added new property to expose fixed file information record.
+ Added new "string array" property to give access to string information by name: this property can access any custom string information if the name is known.
+ Added properties to return number of "translations" and to select index of "translation" to be used.
+ Added properties to return language and character set codes in addition to descriptive strings.
+ All string info, language and character set properties now return values from the currently selected translation (which defaults to the first translation maintaining backward compatibilty).
+ Empty FileName property now accesses name of host application per command line rather than using Application.ExeName.
+ CharSet property now returns '' for unknown value rather than 'Unknown'.
+ Renamed TVersionNumber record to TPJVersionNumber.
+ Replaced Tvs_FixedFileInfo record with use of Windows unit defined type TVSFixedFileInfo.
+ Renamed unit to PJVersionInfo.
+ Changed component palette from "PJ Stuff" to "PJSoft".
+ Added two demo programs, one is a sample version information reading program and the other implements examples from the help file.
