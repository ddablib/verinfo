Release v3.0 of 17 February 2002

+ Added properties to return number of "translations" and to select index of "translation" to be used.
+ Added properties to return language and character set codes in addition to descriptive strings.
+ All string info, language and character set properties now return values from the currently selected translation (which defaults to the first translation maintaining backward compatibility).

Release v2.0.1 of 08 July 1999

+ Added HTML documentation (shared documentation with Release 1.0.1).
