Release 3.0 of 17 February 2002

+ Added properties to return number of "translations" and to select index of "translation" to be used.

+ All string info, language and character set properties now return values from the currently selected translation (which defaults to the first translation maintaining backward compatibilty).
+ Empty FileName property now accesses name of host application per command line rather than using Application.ExeName.

+ Renamed TVersionNumber record to TPJVersionNumber.
+ Replaced Tvs_FixedFileInfo record with use of Windows unit defined type TVSFixedFileInfo.
